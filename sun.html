            The sun can be really bad for skin. It can be more than just the sunburns. 
            Having too much exposure to the sun can cause an increased risk of skin cancer 
            and additionally it can also just cause permanent damage to your skin that 
            overtime can add up. This damage is not limited to lighter skin tones. Darker 
            skin tones can also be affected. One thing to note is that there is an increase 
            in skin tolerance depending on how much melanin there is in the skin. Still it 
            is important to wear sunscreen to avoid any damage.

            Something else about skin care and the sun is that it is important not 
            to be too fanatical. Spending a moderate amount of time in the sun is beneficial. 
            Still, it is important to avoid extremes an exposure. Swimming or being at high 
            altitudes can cause sunburn even though it may not feel too hot. Especially during 
            the winter it can be easy to get a bad burn due to the false sense of security as
            most people take the most precautions in summer
