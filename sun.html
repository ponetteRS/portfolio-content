The sun can be really bad for the skin. It’s not just the sunburns. 
It can be more than that. Having too much exposure to the sun can cause
 an increase risk of skin cancer and additionally it can also just cause 
 permanent damage to your skin that overtime can add up. This is not limited 
 to lighter skin tones. Darker skin tones can also be affected. One thing to 
 note is that there is an increase in skin tolerance depending on how much
  melanin there is in the skin. Still I think it is important to wear 
  sunscreen because I don’t want to have any damage.

Something else about skin care and the sun is that it is important not 
to be too fanatical. I still try to spend some time in the sun because I 
feel a lot better when I do. But I try to avoid extremes an exposure. But 
I consider it seems an exposure is getting sunburnt while swimming or 
being at high altitudes. Especially during the winter I find that I’m not
 too concerned but during the summer I take extra precautions to make sure
  that I am still OK.
