            A persistent theme that I’ve noticed about my life has been the lack of accurate 
            information and marketing involved in skin care. Furthermore, myself and others 
            have all had experiences of burning skin by following information such as 
            putting limes or oranges or other citrus fruits on our faces for a more 
            natural look. I also have felt a lot of pressure to spend a lot of money. I think 
            that in the age of information there’s a lot of access to information but I also 
            feel like it can be hard to discern truth from fiction. I also think that there 
            isn’t always a full representation of diversity when it comes to different skin 
            types on the internet. Additionally, I think it’s important to have realistic 
            expectations of what skin can be rather than having this perfect image that can 
            only be attained through a specific set of products. I think it can lead to a 
            lot of issues with self-esteem. I think that the line between self improvement 
            and trying to live up to an expectation that isn’t reasonable can be a little 
            bit hard to differentiate, especially growing up.

            In terms of skin care as a habit, I feel a sense of comfort in the routine that
            it gives me on a day-to-day basis. I feel like I’ve accomplished something for
            myself when I do my skin care routine. Sometimes I can be stressed or tired or
            just unmotivated and being able to fall back on the sense of routine has been 
            really powerful for me because it is one small thing I can do for myself that 
            will benefit me long term. Something that was freeing for me was realizing that 
            I don’t have to have a super fancy routine, I can have a basic routine that I 
            can do in a cost effective and easy manner. I wish I would’ve known early on that 
            skin care doesn’t have to be a painful chore or a source of pressure, it can be 
            something that’s calm and soothing. I found that simplicity freeing for myself and 
            this website is sort of a look at things that have worked for me and resources that
            I have found helpful.
