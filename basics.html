            I like to use two cleansers. The reason that I like to use two cleansers is 
            because I find that oftentimes I’ll have either makeup or sunscreen or 
            other stuff that I want to get off of my face that won’t come off the first 
            time around. So what I like to do is first use an oil cleanser and I do that 
            because oils will help takeoff other oils from the face. And I feel much 
            cleaner when I am able to do that. Additionally I feel like I’m able to feel
            a little moisturized and I find that I don’t feel my skin tighten when I 
            use oil cleansers versus micellar water or make up remover. One thing to note
            is that I typically only wear lipstick if I do wear makeup so this might not 
            work for everyone.

            The next thing I like to do is use a foaming cleanser. This is because I feel 
            like an oil cleanser always leaves an oily residue on my skin afterwards. I 
            feel like I get that nice dry clean feeling from a foaming cleanser. One 
            thing that I look for in a foaming cleanser is that it has salicylic acid and 
            My reasoning for that is that I want to prevent acne. This is because my skin 
            is super oily and I feel that when I do use salicylic acid my skin looks better 
            and I just feel like it gives me a better feeling knowing that I have that extra 
            protection going for me. That being said, different skin types might need more 
            or less additives in their cleanser.

            I end my routine with moisturizer. And this is because washing my face as much as 
            I do mean that I end up having dryer skin. Even though I said I had oily skin 
            I’ve realized over time that my skin is less oily when I put moisturizer on then 
            when I don’t. Because of this I make sure to always wear moisturizer after I 
            finish my routine.
