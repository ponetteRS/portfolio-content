When I was freaking out my skin care routine something that really helped
 me was finding information. Some of the resources that I found really
  helpful weâ€™re read it. The reason why I found read it very useful 
  resource it was because I was able to get tips and advice from people 
  first hand. Additionally if I had additional questions I could reach 
  out to them and ask her questions. I found a sense of community on the 
  skin care Paige and I felt like I was able to have a sense of camaraderie 
  going into the skin care process.

Something that I would advise against is taking information from shady 
website or not listening to new information. The reasoning is that falls 
knees can be very detrimental to the experience as a whole. It is very easy 
to be sweet away by marketing or people who are misinformed. That is why I 
always make sure to double check any information that I have.
