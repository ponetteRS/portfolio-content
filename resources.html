When I was figuring out my skin care routine something that really helped
me was finding information from other people interested in skin care. 
Some of the resources that I found really helpful were communities on 
reddit. The reason why I found read reddit a very useful resource was 
because I was able to get tips and advice from people first hand such as
new websites and other addditional resource hubs. Additionally since posts 
can reach many people I was able to find out differing opinions and tips 
for finding a derm. I also found a sense of community on the skin care page 
and I felt like I was able to have a sense of camaraderie going into the 
skin care process as a newbie.

Something that I would advise against is taking information as a fact online 
running it through a fact checker like Snopes. The pages I used were nice for 
basic skin care like cleansers and how to find dermswhich did not cover 
medical concerns. Even for basic skin care, opinions vary so I try not take 
person's idea as a fact and make sure to always be open to new information as 
well as strive to get reputable sources for things like medical questions.
