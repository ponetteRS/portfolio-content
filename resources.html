            When I was figuring out my skin care routine something that really helped
            me was finding information from other people interested in skin care. 
            Some of the resources that I found really helpful were communities on 
            reddit. The reason why I found read reddit a very useful resource was 
            because I was able to get tips and advice from people first hand such as
            new websites and other addditional resource hubs. Additionally since posts 
            can reach many people I was able to find out differing opinions and tips 
            for finding a derm. I also found a sense of community on the skin care page 
            and I felt like I was able to have a sense of camaraderie going into the 
            skin care process as a newbie.
        </p>

        <p>
            Something that I would advise against is taking information as a fact online 
            running it through a fact checker like Snopes. The pages I used were nice for 
            basic skin care like cleansers and how to find dermswhich did not cover 
            medical concerns. Even for basic skin care, opinions vary so I try not take 
            person's idea as a fact and make sure to always be open to new information as 
            well as strive to get reputable sources for things like medical questions.
